## 🏥 Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use **Machine Learning in Python** to predict the **medical insurance premium** charged to individuals based on their background details such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and more.

By analyzing this dataset and training a regression model, we can estimate insurance costs for new applicants, which is useful for both consumers and insurance companies.

### 🗃️ About the Dataset

The dataset includes several features related to individuals such as:

* **Age**
* **Sex**
* **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
* **Number of children**
* **Smoker status**
* **Region**
* **Charges** (insurance premium)

**Target Variable**: `charges` – the medical insurance cost to be predicted.
